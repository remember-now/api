/**
 * Builds the `WITH RECURSIVE bfs(id, kind, depth, visited) AS (...)` CTE
 * shared by EntityNodeRepository.searchByBfs and EntityEdgeRepository.searchByBfs.
 *
 * The CTE seeds from `originNodeIds` resolved against both entity_nodes and
 * episodic_nodes (tagging each row's `kind`), then expands one entity-graph
 * hop per step. Episodic seeds expand via episodic_edges (MENTIONS) to entity
 * once at depth 1; from there it's a pure entity-graph traversal.
 *
 * Returned fragment includes the leading `WITH RECURSIVE`, so it must be the
 * first SQL in the statement. Callers append their outer SELECT after it:
 *
 *   const cte = buildBfsCte(originNodeIds, graphIds, depth);
 *   await prisma.$queryRaw`
 *     ${cte}
 *     SELECT ... FROM bfs b JOIN entity_nodes n ON n.id = b.id WHERE ...
 *   `;
 *
 * Shape constraints worth knowing: Postgres requires exactly one non-recursive
 * term + one recursive term separated by a single UNION [ALL], and the
 * recursive term may reference the CTE at most once (error 42P19). The two
 * seed arms are collapsed into a subquery anchor; the two expansion arms are
 * merged through a LATERAL subquery so `bfs` is referenced exactly once.
