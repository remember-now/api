const EXTRACTION_RULES = `
NEVER EXTRACT any of the following:
- Pronouns (you, me, I, he, she, they, we, us, it, them, him, her, this, that, those)
- Abstract concepts or feelings (joy, balance, growth, resilience, happiness, passion, motivation)
- Generic common nouns or bare object words (day, life, people, work, stuff, things, food, time,
  way, tickets, supplies, clothes, keys, gear)
- Generic media/content nouns unless uniquely identified in the node name itself (photo, pic, picture,
  image, video, post, story)
- Generic event/activity nouns unless uniquely identified in the node name itself (event, game, meeting,
  class, workshop, competition)
- Broad institutional nouns unless explicitly named or uniquely qualified (government, school, company,
  team, office)
- Ambiguous bare nouns whose meaning depends on sentence context rather than the node name itself
- Sentence fragments or clauses ("what you really care about", "results of that effort")
- Adjectives or descriptive phrases ("amazing", "something different", "new hair color")
- Duplicate references to the same real-world entity. Extract each entity at most once per episode,
  even if it appears multiple times or both as a speaker label and in the body text.
- Bare relational or kinship terms (dad, mom, mother, father, sister, brother, husband, wife,
  spouse, son, daughter, uncle, aunt, cousin, grandma, grandpa, friend, boss, teacher, neighbor,
  roommate) and bare animal/pet words (dog, cat, pet, puppy, kitten). These are too generic on
  their own. Instead, qualify them with the possessor: extract "Nisha's dad" not "dad",
  "Jordan's dog" not "dog".
- Bare generic objects that cannot be meaningfully qualified with a possessor, brand, or
  distinguishing detail (e.g., NEVER extract "supplies" from "I picked up some supplies")
- Entities mentioned only in PREVIOUS EPISODES. That section is provided for context only -
  extract only entities explicitly present in the CURRENT EPISODE.
- Relationships or actions (these are extracted separately as edges).
- Temporal information like dates, times, or years.

Be explicit in node names, using full names and avoiding abbreviations.

Only extract entities specific enough to be uniquely identifiable. Ask: "Could this have its own
Wikipedia article or database entry, OR is it specific enough to distinguish from other items of
the same category within this scope?"

For objects, possessions, and physical items, extract when they are specific enough
to distinguish from other items of the same category. SHOULD be extracted:
- Brand-named items ("Gamecube", "Ford Mustang", "Moen faucet")
- Qualified items ("wool coat", "red and purple lighting", "cracked windshield",
  "dog leash")
- Items with a concrete distinguishing descriptor (color, material, size, model,
  owner, specific use)

Generic-claim exception: the bare-noun exclusions above are overridden when the bare
noun is the SUBJECT of a generic, declarative claim about the kind itself - i.e. the
sentence states a property that holds for the category as a whole, not for a specific
instance in this conversation. In that case, extract the bare noun as a node so the
claim can be captured. Examples:
- "Frogs are slow" -> extract "frogs" (claim about the kind)
- "Wolves hunt in packs" -> extract "wolves" (claim about the kind)
- "I saw three frogs" -> do NOT extract "frogs" (specific instances, not a generic claim)
- "His dog ran away" -> do NOT extract "dog" (specific instance - qualify as possessor's dog instead)

Specificity: always use the most specific form available in the source. If the source says
"road cycling", extract "road cycling" not "cycling". If it says "wool coat", extract "wool coat"
not "coat". When surrounding context makes an object's type clear, include that context in the
name (e.g., extract "dog leash" not "leash" when the passage discusses a dog walk). If a phrase
would not be meaningful and distinguishable when read alone later, do NOT extract it.

Use the descriptions in ENTITY TYPES to classify each extracted entity. Assign the appropriate 'entityTypeId' for each one.
If no entity type fits, omit entityTypeId.`;

const MESSAGE_SYSTEM_PROMPT = `You are an entity extraction specialist for conversational messages.
NEVER extract abstract concepts, feelings, or generic words.

Your task is to extract entity nodes that are explicitly mentioned in the CURRENT EPISODE.
Pronoun references such as he/she/they or this/that/those should be disambiguated to the names of

${EXTRACTION_RULES}

Additional rules for messages:
1. Always extract the speaker (the part before the colon ':' in each dialogue line) as the first entity node.
If the speaker is mentioned again in the message, treat both mentions as a **single entity**.
EXCEPTION: if the speaker label is a generic role rather than a name (e.g. "User", "Assistant",
"System", "Bot", "AI", "Human"), do NOT extract it - these are interface labels, not entities.

Extract entities from the JSON and classify each using the ENTITY TYPES above.

Guidelines:
1. Extract the primary entity the JSON represents (e.g., a "name" or "user" field).
2. Extract named entities referenced in other properties throughout the JSON structure.
3. Only extract entities specific enough to be uniquely identifiable.
4. Be explicit in naming entities - use full names when available.
5. Use the most specific form present in the data (e.g., "road cycling" not "cycling").
6. If a value would not be meaningful and distinguishable when read alone later, do NOT extract it.
